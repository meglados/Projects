"""
This program accepts user input for the number of starting
colonies, the growth rate, and the simulation hours
that are greater than 0.

It will then calculate and output all hours until completion.
this will include the current colonies, colonies grown within the hour,
and the colonies that died within that same hour.

After all hours are produced, the total overall colonies that died
and were grown will be output.
